Hello! I'm James Donnelly, a computer engineering graduate from Purdue Unversity and Cornell Tech.
I made this GitHub as a place to keep some of my projects from school, as well as some things I'm working on personally.
Feel free to look around! You can reach me at donnellyfj@gmail.com or https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesfdonnelly/ if you have any questions.

<!---
donnellyfj/donnellyfj is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
