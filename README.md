## Hello!
I'm James Donnelly, a computer engineering graduate from Purdue Unversity and Cornell Tech.
I made this GitHub as a place to keep some of my projects from school, as well as some things I'm working on personally.
Feel free to look around! You can reach me at donnellyfj@gmail.com or https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesfdonnelly/ if you have any questions.

## Projects
### Explo
Explo is iOS app I developed with some friends ([@WeDebuGing](https://github.com/WeDebuGing), [@Kalva014](https://github.com/Kalva014), [@jenny-ll](https://github.com/jenny-ll), and [@idodra](https://github.com/idodra)) during my time at Cornell Tech. The idea started as a classroom project, but we wanted to keep up with it both for fun and for our own learning. The idea was to build a social media platform centered around restaurants. Users can post restaurants they've been to, write reviews, add their friends on the platform, and see on a map the different places around them that their friends have been to. When you're in a new area, it can be difficult to explore. You might always not always know what's out there, and even if you do, it can be daunting to make that first step and decide where you want to go. The goal is for Explo to provide a unique solution to these problems, while adding extra elements of gamification through leaderboards and contests. The app was built using React Native, and implements a number of API's such as Google Maps, Google Places, and various GCP tools.

### Competitive Programming
Since graduating from Cornell, I've been lucky enough to intern with the International Collegiate Programming Contest [(ICPC)](https://icpc.global/). As interns, we participate in various programming competitions and solve coding problems on platforms like LeetCode and Codeforces, and each week we come together to present and discuss our favorite problems from the week and the solutions we came up with. This repo contains a number of my solutions to these problems since joining the internship.

### VRms
For my senior design project at Purdue, a few students and I created a VR controlled robot arm (VR + arms = VRms). This project was very unique to me as it was the first time I had the chance to put together all of the things I had learned to that point into one cohesive product. My teammates and I developed the project with Unity VR, embedded systems design, video streaming through a Raspberry Pi, and by designing and assembling a PCB from scratch. More details on our design process and project demos can be found [here](https://477-vrms.github.io/vrm-website/), and our GitHub organization can be found [here](https://github.com/477-vrms).

### Cone Detection
A model that detects cones in images and their distances from the camera using multivairate Gaussian distributions alongside Bayes' Theorem.

### Gesture Recognition
A model that detects gestures present in IMU data using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) with the Baum-Welch algorithm.
