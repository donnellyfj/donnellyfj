## Hello!
I'm James Donnelly, a computer engineering graduate from Purdue Unversity and Cornell Tech.
I made this GitHub as a place to keep some of my projects from school, as well as some things I'm working on personally.
Feel free to look around! You can reach me at donnellyfj@gmail.com or https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesfdonnelly/ if you have any questions.

## Projects
### Explo
Explo is iOS app I've been developing as a personal project with some friends ([@WeDebuGing](https://github.com/WeDebuGing), [@Kalva014](https://github.com/Kalva014), [@jenny-ll](https://github.com/jenny-ll), and [@idodra](https://github.com/idodra)) during my time at Cornell Tech. The idea started as a classroom project, but I wanted to keep up with it both for fun and for my own learning. The idea was to build a social media platform centered around restaurants. Users can post restaurants they've been to, write reviews, add their friends on the platform, and see on a map the different places around them that their friends have been to. When you're in a new area, it can be difficult to explore. You might always not always know what's out there, and even if you do, it can be daunting to make that first step and decide where you want to go. The goal is for Explo to provide a unique solution to these problems, while adding extra elements of gamification through leaderboards and contests. The app was built using React Native, and implements a number of API's such as Google Maps, Google Places, and various GCP tools.
